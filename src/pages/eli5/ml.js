    <h2> Machine learning papers broken down</h2>
    <p>
      Here's my version of breaking down important machine learning papers, with a focus on <b>computer vision</b>. It's aimed at 
      industry professionals that are interested in understanding and applying cutting-edge research methods and technqiues in their work 
      but don't have an extremely strong math/ statistics background. Ideally, each post should be able to break down the <b>essential 
      components of the paper</b> as well as give <b>actionable advice</b> at the end to apply what you've learned.
